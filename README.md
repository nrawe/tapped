# Tapped
> It's testing, Jim, but not as we know it

This represents an attempt to write an elegant, simple testing framework for PHP. It is based on [Test Anything Protocol](https://testanything.org/tap-version-13-specification.html), and leverages the advances in PHP7.

The [wiki](https://github.com/nrawe/tapped/wiki) has all the information about how to use the framework.


## Roadmap

This project is a very early release. It's basically functional, but lacking in a lot
of areas.

Please see the [Project](https://github.com/nrawe/tapped/projects/1) for more information.


## License

This project is release under an [MIT License](LICENSE).
